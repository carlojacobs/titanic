    "## How does a neural network work?\n",
    "\n",
    "### The architecture of a neural network\n",
    "\n",
    "A **neural network** is the most popular tool that is used in machine learning today, it can accurately predict events after being trained on a large dataset. A neural network (NN) consists of layers. Each of these layers contain **neurons**. These neurons are associated an activation determined by their inputs and other variables. An NN is based on a collection of these neurons, which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. Each connection, like the synapses in a biological brain, can transmit a signal from one neuron to another. A neuron that receives a signal can process it and then signal additional neurons connected to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Neural network](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/60/ArtificialNeuronModel_english.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each neuron has some quantaties associated to it. The input, is given by $$p_j\\left(t\\right) = \\sum_{i} o\\left(t\\right)_i w_{ij} + w_{0j}.$$ Where,\n",
    "- $p_j\\left(t\\right)$ is the input of the neuron.\n",
    "- $i$ is the index summing over all the predecessor neurons.\n",
    "- $o_i\\left(t\\right)$ is the output from neuron's predecessor.\n",
    "- $w_{ij}$ is the weight associated with the neuron.\n",
    "- $w_{0j}$ is the bias associated with the neuron.\n",
    "\n",
    "To each neuron there is associated an activation function $f$ that is dependent on $p_j$. This function maps the neurons input to a value that we call its **activation** $a_j$. Some commonly used activation function are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sigmoid: $f\\left(p\\right) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-p}}.$\n",
    "- ReLU: $f\\left(p\\right) = \\text{max}\\left(0, p\\right).$\n",
    "- Hyperbolic tangent: $f\\left(p\\right) = \\tanh \\left(p\\right).$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learing of the network\n",
    "\n",
    "The NN learns to accurately perform its task by constantly trying to minimize a **cost function**. Given a specific task to solve, and a class of functions $F$, learning means using a set of observations to find $f^{*}\\in F$ which solves the task in some optimal sense. This entails defining a cost function $C:F\\rightarrow \\mathbb {R}$  such that, for the optimal solution $f^{*},  C(f^{*})\\leq C(f)\\, \\forall f\\in F$. This can be done by a process called backpropagation. Backpropagation is a method that calculates the gradient of the cost function with respect to the weights in the NN. The weights are then updated according to this gradient. One example of backpropagation is **Stochastic Gradient Descent** and it can be described by the following equation $$w_{ij}\\left(t+1\\right) = w_{ij}\\left(t\\right) + \\eta \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial w_{ij}} + \\zeta \\left(t\\right).$$ Where,\n",
    "- $\\eta$ is the learning rate.\n",
    "- $C$ the cost function.\n",
    "- $\\zeta \\left(t\\right)$ a stochastic term.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the method of backpropagtion, the network can update its weigths to minimize the cost function and get optimal results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adjusting the degrees of freedom of a neural network\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of neural network has multiple degrees of freedom that can be adjusted in order to increase the performance or accuracy of a neural network. Some examples are\n",
    "- The learning rate.\n",
    "- The number of layers in the network.\n",
    "- The activation function of each layer.\n",
    "- The cost funciton.\n",
    "- The sample size of training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no fixed rulebook on how to set up these parameters. There are only certain estimations that suggest a certain amount of layers or a certain learning rate dependent on (for example) your sample size."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "Machine learning is a very powerful but complicated tool. It can be extremely useful for solving a large range of problems. Not to mention that it is a lot of fun to develop. Using A fairly simple NN we were able to predict with reasonable accuracy if a passenger on the Titanic was likely to survive or not. We used the power of `Python3` combined with `Numpy` to handle our data, the magic of `Matplotlib` to give us great insight into our dataset and the finesse of `Keras` and its linear algebra to construct a self-learning model that has come to know the ins and outs of this spectacular disaster."
