    "In this notebook we will be diving into the inner workings of a neural network. We will be creating a machine learning model using python 3 and we will train this model on a dataset I acquired from [this](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) kaggle competition. Kaggle is a free online datascience platform that hosts machine learning competitions with datasets provided by companies or organizations.

    "\n",
    "A **neural network** is one of the most popular tools that is used in machine learning today, it can accurately predict things after being trained on a large dataset. A neural network (NN) consists of layers. Each of these layers contain **neurons**. These neurons are associated an activation determined by their inputs and other variables. An NN is based on a collection of these neurons, which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. Each connection, like the synapses in a biological brain, can transmit a signal from one neuron to another. A neuron that receives a signal can process it and then signal additional neurons connected to it."

    "### Learing of the network\n",
    "\n",
    "The NN learns to accurately perform its task by constantly trying to minimize a **cost function**. Given a specific task to solve, and a class of functions $F$, learning means using a set of observations to find $f^{*}\\in F$ which solves the task in some optimal sense. This entails defining a cost function $C:F\\rightarrow \\mathbb {R}$  such that, for the optimal solution $f^{*},  C(f^{*})\\leq C(f)\\, \\forall f\\in F$. This can be done by a process called backpropagation. Backpropagation is a method that calculates the gradient of the cost function with respect to the weights in the NN. The weights are then updated according to this gradient. One example of backpropagation is **Stochastic Gradient Descent** and it can be described by the following equation $$w_{ij}\\left(t+1\\right) = w_{ij}\\left(t\\right) + \\eta \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial w_{ij}} + \\zeta \\left(t\\right).$$ Where,\n",
    "- $\\eta$ is the learning rate.\n",
    "- $C$ the cost function.\n",
    "- $\\zeta \\left(t\\right)$ a stochastic term.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the method of backpropagtion, the network can update its weigths to minimize the cost function and get optimal results."

    "### Dimensions\n",
    "It is very important that the initial input shape matches the dimensions of the input data, in this case this shape would be 7. It is also important that the number of neurons in the last/output layer of the network matches the dimensions of the output data. In this case 2.\n",

    "The Softmax activation function, which we use in our second layer, takes an un-normalized vector (in this case the vector form of the second `Dense` layer), and normalizes it into a probability distribution. That is, prior to applying softmax, some vector elements could be negative, or greater than one; and might not sum to 1; but after applying softmax, each element $x_{i}$ is in the interval $\\left[0,1\\right]$, and $\\sum _{i}x_{i}=1.$ The general softmax function is of the form\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "Machine learning is a very powerful but complicated tool. It can be extremely useful for solving a large range of problems. Not to mention that it is a lot of fun to develop. Using A fairly simple NN we were able to predict with reasonable accuracy if a passenger on the Titanic was likely to survive or not. We used the power of `Python3` combined with `Numpy` to handle our data, the magic of `Matplotlib` to give us great insight into our dataset and the finesse of `Keras` and its linear algebra to construct a self-learning model that has come to know the ins and outs of this spectacular disaster."
