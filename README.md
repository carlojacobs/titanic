# Machine Learning from Disaster: Would You Have Survived?
In this project, I used machine learning to try and predict if a person was likely to survive the Titanic disaster. Using a dataset I obtained from [this kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic), I was able to train a simple neural network up to 94% accuracy. As a finishing touch, I built a neat little web-app around the model.
## Tools
For this project, I used `Python3`, my favourite language. In addition, I used several libraries for multiple purposes:
- [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) for linear algebra and other types of scientific computing.
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) for data analysation and manipulation.
- [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) for building the machine learing model.
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) for visualizing and analysing data.
